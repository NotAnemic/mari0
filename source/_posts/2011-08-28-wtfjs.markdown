Inspired by <a href="http://wtfjs.com/">this site</a>, I've decided to share my own "WTF, JS!" moment.

My example involves unexpected behaviour in console.log. Consider the following snippet.

```javascript
	for(i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		a.push(i)
		console.log(a);
	}
```

Pretty straightforward, right?  Think about what output you would expect when running that code. Maybe it would look a little like this?

```
	[0]
	[0, 1]
	[0, 1, 2]
	[0, 1, 2, 3]
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Seems reasonable. But console.log, it would seem, prints asynchronously. So your actual output will look like this.

```
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
	[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

I should, apparently, stop using this for debugging. What the fuck.
