    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I set this up because thought a github-hosted site was a neat idea. I'm not sure if I'll use it for anything particularly interesting. I might write about my experiences professionally but even regarding an interesting job hearing thing second-hand is rarely exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write about my various personal projects. I would like to have some place explaining sort of what I've already done or having a development log for ongoing projects. A place to broadcast ideas that I've had or would otherwise like to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do know what I don't want to do, though: a stream-of-consciousness blog or a collection of reviews. Or, you know, anything like this particular post.&lt;/p&gt;
