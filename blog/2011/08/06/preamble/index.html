I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll use it for anything particularly interesting. I might write about my experiences professionally but even regarding an interesting job hearing thing second-hand is rarely exciting.</p>
<p>I could write about my various personal projects. I would like to have some place explaining sort of what I&#39;ve already done or having a development log for ongoing projects. A place to broadcast ideas that I&#39;ve had or would otherwise like to share.</p>
<p>I do know what I don&#39;t want to do, though: a stream-of-consciousness blog or a collection of reviews. Or, you know, anything like this particular post.</p>
