It&#39;s expressive, powerful, easy to read and easy to write. It maintains a lot of features that people like and expect in a language, it has a simple and intuitive package manager and it has an enormous repository of frameworks and APIs that do a lot and work well.</p>
<p>I am relatively new to the Ruby world so this is a simplistic view of a complicated issue but it is a valid newcomer&#39;s perspective: Ruby is a good language; idiomatic Ruby is not. I&#39;d like to share some of my frustrations while learning ruby alongside someone who follows these practises.<!--more--></p>
<p>Implicit return statements are evil. Their only benefit is saving keystrokes but they make the code less immediately readable and less self-documenting. For a language that prides itself in having code made sense &quot;in English&quot; when it is read, the implicit return statement is both harmful and bizarre.</p>
<p>Using unless is a giant bag of worms. There are, I think, good times to use unless as a replacement for if not but I think that, often, the temptation to use it needlessly is too great for developers.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ruby">    good(<span class="hljs-keyword">use</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">unless</span> dev == lazy
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-ruby">    unless there<span class="hljs-number">_</span><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span><span class="hljs-number">_</span>a<span class="hljs-number">_</span>very<span class="hljs-number">_</span>good<span class="hljs-number">_</span>reason

</code></pre>
<p>Why would you not put parentheses around your method calls? I even like doing this one but I still know it&#39;s a bad idea. Trading a few keystrokes for the ability for everyone to read and understand your code with the least amount of difficulty is a trade-off we should be very, very rarely willing to make. I&#39;m sure there are others that I&#39;m not mentioning but these are the most immediate and violent offenders to my sensibilities.</p>
