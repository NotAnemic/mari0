It was, as always, so amazing to see 300 people come together and build a community as well as some kick-ass games in 48 hours. A million thanks to Troy Darc and Randy Orenstein and their supporting cast for making TGGJ happen and making it feel as good as it does.</p> <p>This weekend, I made a game called Sportball. It&#39;s a multiplayer game where you try to coerce a lot of coloured units into pushing a ball into your coloured net. The game was made with gamepads in mind but it can also be played with WASD and arrows keys on a keyboard. It&#39;s very easy to lose your units but they are constantly respawning so you just need to make sure you don&#39;t lose as many as your opponent while you&#39;re trying to score a goalpoint.</p> <p>The concept was inspired by the <a href=http://www.mariowiki.com/Double_Cherry>Double Cherry</a> item in Super Mario 3D World. It duplicates the character you&#39;re controlling and I thought it was so fun that I wanted to make a game where that was the main mechanic. My team on this project was Erica Gregory for art and Maggie McLean for music. They both did a fantastic job and this game wouldn&#39;t be nearly as good without them.</p> <p><a href=http://imgur.com/a/yantK>Screenshots</a></p> <p></p><h3>Downloads:</h3><p></p> <ul> <li><a href=https://stackmachine.com/games/c33f8fbe1432eda332cc68ac/download/windows>Windows</a></li> <li><a href=https://stackmachine.com/games/c33f8fbe1432eda332cc68ac/download/osx>OSX</a></li> <li><a href=https://stackmachine.com/games/c33f8fbe1432eda332cc68ac/download/love>.love</a></li> </ul> <p>One thing I&#39;m trying is to distribute this game (at least initially) through <a href=https://stackmachine.com>StackMachine</a>. It&#39;s a very clever little website that packages, updates and gives error reports on your game. If you make anything using the Love2D framework, I recommended checking it out.</p> <p>Grab a friend and try out some Sportball!</p> </div></div><link href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.1.0/styles/github-gist.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/></div></body></html>
